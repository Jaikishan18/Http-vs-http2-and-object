OBJECTS AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION IN JAVA SCRIPT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Objects:
     Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks 
      for modern JavaScript.
     Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of  
     primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.

     "objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, 
      of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs."

  Objects and its Properties :
     A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. 
     A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object.
     1.syntax:
         objectname. any key= any value;
      Properties of JavaScript objects can also be accessed or set using a bracket notation .
      2.syntax:
         objectname['anykey']= 'any value';

  Create JavaScript Object with Object Literal :
     One of easiest way to create a javascript object is object literal, simply define 
     the property and values inside curly braces as shown below.

      EX: let bike = {name: 'SuperSport', maker:'Ducati', engine:'937cc'};
    
  Using the JavaScript Keyword new:
     var person = new Object();
     person.firstName = “John”;
     person.lastName = “Doe”;


  Create JavaScript Object with Constructor:
     Constructor is nothing but a function and 
     with help of new keyword, constructor function allows to create multiple objects of same flavor as shown below
     EX:
     function Vehicle(name, maker) {
   this.name = name;
   this.maker = maker;
   }
     let car1 = new Vehicle(’Fiesta’, 'Ford’);
     let car2 = new Vehicle(’Santa Fe’, 'Hyundai’)
